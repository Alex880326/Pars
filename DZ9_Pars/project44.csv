"I remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasn't going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right. I haven't seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i don't think i will ever see anything like this again. If i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you. I cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month. Awesome work keep it up and best of luck!

17:40 Also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies, and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesn't enough!

"Reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters, we had a course that was just making a game, in groups of 5. After week 1 of ""production"" everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing. I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked ""why does it look so pretty?"" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing.",45,"1","2024-08-16T23:05:31.757245Z",64056,6.901,"2","2024-08-16T23:05:31.757245Z"

"I really recommend you checking out a book “The Art of Game Design” and it’s chapter about prototyping. It really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of “Is there a potential in this design?” it’s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode.

"Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not. If you're having more fun coming up with the story, setting, lore, and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas, then chances are you're more into worldbuilding than game design. Learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests.",80,"1","2024-08-16T23:14:12.913458Z",64062,3.31,"1","2024-08-16T23:14:12.913458Z"
"Hey man, I've been building these, let's call them ""prototypes"" for many years. I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned. 
I know this stupid vicious cycle well.",77,"1","2024-08-16T23:13:09.602397Z",64063,7.241,"1","2024-08-16T23:13:09.602397Z"
"Most of what you're talking about here is called ""abstraction"", despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes. It's a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job. I'd much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue, but also related past issues as well as potential future ones. In the end, if done well, it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability. It's also a puzzle that I tend to take as personal challenges.",78,"1","2024-08-16T23:13:20.744922Z",64064,9.035,"1","2024-08-16T23:13:20.744922Z"

"Here is my feedback:

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
-The main character could shine more while aiming, maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

Overall I loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so I could try it ♥",81,"1","2024-08-16T23:15:03.698831Z",64069,3.045,"2","2024-08-16T23:15:03.698831Z"

"As a game developer I have always taken the ""boring stuff"" incredibly seriously. If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game, you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire game's campaign or whatever else. In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.

Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it.",69,"1","2024-08-16T23:11:05.186546Z",64073,6.831,"2","2024-08-16T23:11:05.186546Z"
