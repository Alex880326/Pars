You have achieved more in 2 years that a whole team of people in 3. Absolutely phenomenal
Congrats on two years of exciting development! Incredibly inspiring.
Congrats man on your 2 years! You're a legend!
"Dude honestly this just looks amazing and I think it's simply inspiring to see someone make this possible. It means we could do it as well, maybe, if we work as hard as you :)"
"I remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasn't going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right. I haven't seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i don't think i will ever see anything like this again. If i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you. I cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month. Awesome work keep it up and best of luck!

17:40 Also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies, and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesn't enough! Also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job! Looks dope!"
"Noice. Congrats on 2 years, the concept art for enemies and missions is looking sick... and I'm excited for what the future holds. ‚ù§"
"I've been watching since the start. this is the best devlog ever, and I can't wait till it's done!"
"Bro this is genuinly nuts, an inspiration to a lot of us . The amount you have got done and learned in 2 years is crazy, good job!"
It's absolutely nuts that this is your *first* game project and it looks so promising already. Just imagine what you'll be able to do in the future if this one is a success
"I didn't know Mark is such a pretty good artist! those art concepts and sprites for his old game ideas looks really nice, I always thought the phase of Prototype is always super important to make sure if a game is gonna be good, I think is possible to already have [these characters and this music and this story] if that's the goal of a game, still I can see how game design can evolved those concepts into something more fitting for whatever the gameplay can be."
I'm the dev who integrated 2D physics into Unity and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. I think I'll be going into the attic to dig out my folder of ideas from my youth too!
"Reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters, we had a course that was just making a game, in groups of 5. After week 1 of ""production"" everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing. I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked ""why does it look so pretty?"" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing."
"GMT: ""Don't over think or over prepare your game""
Me, with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game: *visible sadness*"
"I really recommend you checking out a book ‚ÄúThe Art of Game Design‚Äù and it‚Äôs chapter about prototyping. It really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of ‚ÄúIs there a potential in this design?‚Äù it‚Äôs a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode.

Great video. I think more people should know this stuff."
"To summarize: if you don't make a cheap and fast prototype for your game, then your game is an overdeveloped prototype. And good luck with that!"
"TLDR: Mark learned to ‚ÄúFOCUS ON THE PRIMARY LOOP‚Äù. 

Looks amazing already Mark!  :)"
"Have you considered using the ""recoil"" of the magnet when you catch it to give you a little push, maybe as a kind of ""directional"" double jump?"
"Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not. If you're having more fun coming up with the story, setting, lore, and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas, then chances are you're more into worldbuilding than game design. Learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests."
"Hey man, I've been building these, let's call them ""prototypes"" for many years. I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned. 
I know this stupid vicious cycle well."
"Most of what you're talking about here is called ""abstraction"", despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes. It's a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job. I'd much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue, but also related past issues as well as potential future ones. In the end, if done well, it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability. It's also a puzzle that I tend to take as personal challenges."
"""And yes, I realize that 'future Mark problems' are starting to stack up a bit.""

Welcome to game development. Or software development in general. Or really, making *anything.*"
"Now that Mark knows how to make games, he can take part in the GMTK Game Jam, one of the biggest Game Jams ever"
"Just to clarify it for everyone who's starting: when Mark said: ""it's worth putting in some extra effort at the beginning' he did not mean before the MVP, before you haven't first inspected your core idea(s) are worth pursuing and which are not. 
Fail fast. Fail early. Inspect and adapt."
I‚Äôm so grateful that you focused on the ‚Äúboring stuff‚Äù in this video. It was very illuminating. Thanks!
"Here is my feedback:

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
-The main character could shine more while aiming, maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

Overall I loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so I could try it ‚ô•"
"Imagine being talented and dedicated enough to not just make a game on your own, but also make a high quality video series detailing your design processes at the same time! Really amazing stuff!"
"""And so I abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing I just described""
fantastic line 
üòÖ"
"love this series, I'll admit I was a little sceptical when you changed things on your channel but I am really enjoying this, maybe even more than the video essay type videos

"As a game developer I have always taken the ""boring stuff"" incredibly seriously. If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game, you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire game's campaign or whatever else. In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.

Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it."

I was about to start making my first game my ‚Äúdream game‚Äù. Glad I saw this and now I‚Äôm gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game.
"I started my 2D platformer when I was just starting to learn Unity and C#. I ended up taking a break to make a smaller game; a 2D bullet hell shooter called HyperShot. I put it on Steam, and I still get a sale now and then. Now I'm almost finished my platformer, which will be on Steam next year."
"Hey, glad to see this, I'm about to start making my first game. Thomas always has the best advice"
"Tip # 1 - Consider your hourly rate as a dev, and its relation to your budget.
Tip # 2 - Don't make everything from scratch. Time is money!
Tip # 3 - Don't make your first game your dream game. It should be your 15 minute crap game. You'll figure out your strengths.
Tip # 4 - Focus on prototyping. It's easier to build in pieces, and funding will motivate you.
Tip # 5 - Build a community. Discord and Social Media."
"I wanted to make a 3D survival game, with a massive map with multiple biomes, weird animals, diseases, allergies and of course cut scenes. once I drew the design on some paper I realized that I never had coded before, so this would be way to hard. now I watched this video and I think my first game will just be a simple platformer."
"These are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time I'm wasting.
As for games I worked on a game for most of last year and now that I look back on it I made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but I did find out I am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus I learned a lot about the type of games I am mostly good at making"
"Your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me. I too pride my self in character building and story telling. Those are my passions what keeps me making my game. This being my first game you‚Äôre other tip was perfect, I should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story / dream game. This video hit at the perfect time for me, and thank you for your content. One question about your stories, do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go, drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art?"
I did release my own game on iOS about ten years ago. It was the only personal project I ever released. I outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time. Crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging. I totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go. Great video!
I really enjoy these tip type videos Thomas. They are really motivating. I have my first small-sized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed. Thanks for being motivating. Proud to be part of the gamedev community. :)
"Cool video, I always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time. Keep going!"
Bro this is awesome!!! Keep up the good work man! Ik that your work will shine at one pointüòÑü§©
Keep up the good work!
Awesome stuff!
"Cool video! Keep making the content, its very fun to watch! Though it does keep me of from doing my homework.. Oh and um‚Ä¶ make a game for ios next? :s"
Well done
Really good video it‚Äôs similar to mine but better! lol!
Thanks for the insight
Super underrated video and now I got inspired to make a gta clone too
Actually underrated
